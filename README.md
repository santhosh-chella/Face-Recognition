Face Recognition System — Streamlit + OpenCV
📌 Project Description

This project is a real-time face recognition system built using Streamlit for the interactive web interface and OpenCV for face detection and recognition. It allows users to capture or upload images, process them with OpenCV, and display recognition results instantly in the browser.

The system is designed to run locally (offline), making it lightweight, fast, and privacy-friendly.

🚀 Features

📷 Live Camera Support — Detect and recognize faces in real-time.

🖼 Image Upload — Upload images for recognition testing.

🎭 Face Detection — Uses OpenCV’s Haar cascades and DNN models for accurate detection.

⚡ Streamlit UI — Clean and simple interface for interaction.

💾 Temporary File Handling — Efficient use of Python’s tempfile for image storage.

🔒 Offline Usage — Works without requiring internet access.
